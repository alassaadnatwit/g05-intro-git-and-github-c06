For text descriptions that can change, like the one for entering the kitchen, we use global variables at the top that can be updated from the methods
For inventory items, we have a global array at the top that contains a bool for each inventory item. Change it to be a bunch of seperate bools if you like.
Everything on the ground floor is done. The upstairs and the basement are not.
We need to change it to close the scanners at the end of each method.
Make sure that any endings restart the whole program.
